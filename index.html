        <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
        <p>WWF’s global mission is to stop the degradation of the planet’s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature. WWF-Australia is part of the WWF International Network, the world’s leading, independent conservation organisation. Founded in 1961 we are active in over 100 countries and have close to five million supporters internationally. In Australia and throughout the oceanic region, we work with governments, businesses and communities so that people and nature can thrive within their fair share of the planet’s natural resources. </p>

      <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
      <p>WWF's mission is to halt the decline of threatened plants and animals and to support their recovery. We do this by addressing the threats that affect them using the best available science while working in partnership with communities, Indigenous groups, government and business. We’re focussing on sustainable fisheries, resilient marine ecosystems and clean oceans. The health of our reefs and surrounding oceans means reducing threats to the sharks, rays, penguins, cetaceans and marine turtles that these animals call home. Our drive is to promote a sustainable food system that will conserve nature and feed humanity. We’re looking to reduce waste and environmental impact that contribute to social and economic outcomes.</p>

      <h3>AUSTRALIA NEEDS OUR HELP</h3>
      <p>The catastrophic Australian bushfires last summer were one of the greatest disasters in our nation's history. The firefighters who battled the blazes and the vets, wildlife carers and emergency workers who worked tirelessly to save our Australian wildlife showed amazing courage and compassion. But the staggering losses - of human life, homes and animals - have cast Australia into unchartered territory. Old solutions simply cannot meet our mounting contemporary challenges.</p>

      <h3>KOALA'S FOREVER</h3>
      <p>The koala is the quintessential Australian animal, known globally, much loved and facing a crisis. As one of the world's most iconic animal species, we are on a mission to double the number of koalas across eastern Australia by 2050. Koalas already faced potential extinction before the bushfires because of deforestation, but now the fires have pushed them to the brink. They are an integral part of the Australian bush, but sadly, being iconic is not enough to save the koala from the threat of extinction.</p>

      <h3>DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF KOALAS BY 2050</h3>
      <p>WWF-Australia is determined to turn this tragedy around, and we need your help. With the right investments and decisions, we can double the number of koalas in eastern Australia by 2050! Our plan is not just to bring koalas back across eastern Australia but to give them the chance to thrive, not just survive. To achieve this, we will need to invest in bolstering the capacity of wildlife hospitals in priority areas, starting with hospital upgrades as well as mobile veterinary units. And, we will work to develop a legacy, state of the art wildlife hospital that will meet the high standard of care for Australia’s injured wildlife whilst providing an immersive community education experience.
